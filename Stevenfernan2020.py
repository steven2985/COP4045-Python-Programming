# 2. Save a copy with your FAU username + the '.py' extension
# 3. Modify the code to reflect your name, major, gpa, and hobbies
# 4. Debug and test your code
# 5. Once it's working as intended, submit your .py file via Canvas
# 6. (BONUS) Post your code on a shareable Jupyter site (e.g., Google Colab [1] 
# or Binder [2]) and submit the URl via Canvas
